# Password Generator

## Description

This website was made to generate a password with five easy steps. I built this project because at times
I found myself needing a new password and having trouble of thinking of one. This website solves that problem
and also adds special characters,numbers,uppercase letters, and lowercase letters. While doing this project I learned 
how to work with functions in Javascript and using if and for loops in them. 

## Installation

The project is a website so no steps required to install. Get to website by

Step 1: Click generate password
Step 2: Input how long you want your password(Must be no less then 8 and 
not greater then 128).
Step 3: Input ok if you want lowercase letters or cancel if you do not.
Step 4: Input ok if you want uppercase letters or cancel if you do not.
Step 5: Input ok if you want numbers or cancel if you do not.
Step 6: Input ok if you want special characters or cancel if you do not.
Step 7: The new password is generated in the box.
